# Space Communication Security System

## Overview

The **Space Communication Security System (SCSS)** is a high-assurance framework designed to ensure secure, resilient, and efficient communication between Earth stations, satellites, and deep-space missions. Built using cutting-edge technologies like **quantum encryption**, **optical laser communication**, **AI-based threat detection**, and **post-quantum cryptography**, this project addresses modern space cybersecurity challenges and future-proofs space-based communication systems.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
Implements **quantum encryption** for ground-to-satellite communication using entangled photons, ensuring tamper-evident key exchange with absolute confidentiality.

### 📡 Optical Laser Communication
Supports **high-speed, secure laser-based data transfer** with narrow-beam focus to reduce interception risks and increase data throughput.

### 🧠 AI-Driven Intrusion Detection
Utilizes **machine learning algorithms** to detect anomalies such as jamming, spoofing, and unauthorized access in real-time.

### 🛡️ Post-Quantum Cryptography
Incorporates **post-quantum algorithms** like lattice-based cryptography to resist quantum computing threats.

### 🛰️ Satellite Crosslink Encryption
Secures inter-satellite communication with **end-to-end encryption and autonomous routing** to reduce exposure to ground threats.

```

- **SDR (Software-Defined Radio)**: Enables in-flight cryptographic upgrades and reconfigurations.
- **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)**: Ensures onboard processors execute only verified, signed firmware.
- **Blockchain Audit Layer**: Records all command and telemetry actions securely for non-repudiation.
